# C-program-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-the-string-using-Caesar-Cypher-Algorithm & C program to encrypt and decrypt the string using RSA algorithm.

1st option
For encryption and decryption, we have used 3 as a key value.

While encrypting the given string, 'shift' value is added to the ASCII value of the characters. Similarly, for decrypting the string, 'shift' value is subtracted from the ASCII value of the characters to print an original string.


2nd option
C program to encrypt and decrypt the string using RSA algorithm.
RSA is another method for encrypting and decrypting the message. It involves public key and private key, where the public key is known to all and is used to encrypt the message whereas private key is only used to decrypt the encrypted message.
