# C-program-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-the-string-using-Caesar-Cypher-Algorithm.

For encryption and decryption, we have used 'shift'variable value as a key value.

While encrypting the given string, 'shift' value is added to the ASCII value of the characters. Similarly, for decrypting the string, 'shift' value is subtracted from the ASCII value of the characters to print an original string.
